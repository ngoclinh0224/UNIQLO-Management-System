# UNIQLO-Management-System

This project designs and implements a complete database management system for UNIQLO’s retail operations in England. It aims to streamline core business processes such as inventory management, sales tracking, customer loyalty programs, supplier coordination, and store operations.

The system is built using SQL Server, with a full development pipeline including business analysis, data collection, ERD modeling, relational schema design, database creation, data insertion, and a set of business-driven SQL queries that answer real operational questions (best-selling products, customer loyalty insights, supplier performance, and automatic inventory updates).

Key components include:

- Entity–Relationship Diagram (ERD) capturing customers, stores, managers, products, categories, suppliers, bills, inventory, pricing, and sales.

- Relational schema designed for accuracy, normalization, and scalability.

- Automated triggers to update inventory and profit when transactions occur.

- A collection of business queries for analytics and decision-making (top customers, sales ranking, seasonal trends, low-stock alerts, etc.).

This project demonstrates how a well-structured database can enhance operational efficiency, support data-driven insights, and improve the overall retail management process for a modern, fast-growing fashion brand like UNIQLO.
